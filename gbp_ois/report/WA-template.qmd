CPI (Weds, xxx): 

Labour market: 


## Macro narrative  
_Starting point_ The UK faces an ongoing inflation problem of above-target inflation; and while unemployment is historically low, it is rising and starting to open up some slack. Facing this 'stagflationary' impulse, a fiscal tightening (of around 3% of GDP) is still planned over coming years, but will be politically difficult to implement -- implying a risk of 'fiscal fatigue' that induces some bond market volatility. The BoE requires some degree of slack to open-up if it is to ensure a return of CPI to its 2.0% target, from 3.8% currently. 

_Policy_ Facing this trade-off between the speed of returning inflation to target and degree of economic slack, we expect the BoE to hold Bank Rate at 4.0% until the new year. The Autumn Budget (Nov 26) is a key event, where fiscal policy will be tightened by around 1% of GDP to meet HMG's fiscal rules -- although how front-loaded is that tightening is much less clear (an additional freezing in personal allowances will be back-loaded into 2028 and 2029). If some of the tax rises are front-loaded then it will encourage the BoE to lower Bank Rate by weighing on growth and inflation, bringing Bank Rate closer to a neutral rate which we assume is 3.5%. We expect a next rate cut to 3.75% takes place in February, with market pricing implying some risk of a rate cut before then. 

Volatility in bond markets, particularly at the long-end, draws attention both to the MPC's QT decision and the DMO's funding strategy. We and Consensus expect the MPC to tilt away from asking markets to absorb so much long-end duration. That points to the BoE ending its active QT sales over the next year, taking its annual run-off from GBP100bn to GBP50bn, and the DMO to further reduce its issuance of long-dated debt.

_Outlook and Risks_ The MPC is divided on the timing of the next rate cut. Differences in view on the need to allow for uncertain supply-shocks that weigh on the economy's speed llimit or that may have affected wage- and price-setting are key sources of division. If wage growth moderates as expected, and partly because businesses doubt their ability to pass on higher wages into higher prices, then the MPC will be more comfortable with a rate cut. If wage growth remains elevated, and/or if inflation expectations become unanchored, then the MPC will want to see more evidence of slack before cutting rates.

2. The pattern of past forecast errors points to a material upside inflation risk, if that pattern is repeated partly on underestimating the UK's supply-side weakness.  
3. Fiscal sustainability concerns amplify bond market volatility, particularly at the long-end and during data-driven periods. Disappointing economic data, coming from weak supply-side performance, simultaneously raise questions about fiscal capacity and inflation persistence. In these episodes, yield curve steepening and risk premium episodes should be expected.  
4. The authorities can mitigate yield curve steepening through active debt management, now a bigger feature of the UK policy mix, reducing the average maturity of new issuance. A second policy option to contain steepening is that HMT prioritises restraint in public spending and tax rises that face lower implementation risk (eg re-profiling fixed investment plans). Back-loading fiscal adjustment has the opposite effect.  
5. Fiscal fatigue is a key source of fiscal risk. Symptoms of this risk crystallising would be the authorities back-loading fiscal adjustment and/or types of spenidng restraint (or tax rises) with higher implementation risk. This would contribute to further steepening.  
6. Fiscal risk premium episodes tilt hawkish for the BoE. Our sense is that this view surprises most analysts. Our current forecast is for the BoE to cut Bank Rate to 3.75% in November, but that forecast is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
